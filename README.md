## Inspiration

Tabs Toronto is inspired by a [project of the same name][tabs-archive] which ran from 2012-2018, created by Bill Cowen, [Christian Muise][], [Jayme Turney][] and several others.
This original project won first place after being initiated at a hackathon hosted by [Random Hacks of Kindness Toronto][rhokto] (RHoKTO) in December 2012.
It was later lovingly incubated by the now defunct [Toronto Public Space Initiative][tpsi].
