# tabstoronto-scraper
A tool and service to monitor agenda items of interest for upcoming City of Toronto council/committee meetings. 


## How it works
- Users specify a search terms, and provide an email address at which they'd like to receive notifications.
- A scraper runs nightly, conducting searches and sending emails if new agenda items are found.


## Inspiration

Tabs Toronto was inspired by a project of the same name which ran from 2012-2018, created by Bill Cowen, Christian Muise, Jayme Turney and several others.
