								<h2>Inspiration</h2>
								<p>Tabs Toronto is inspired by a <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20201130071344/http://tabstoronto.com/">project of the same name</a> which ran from 2012-2018, created by Bill Cowen, <a href="http://haz.ca">Christian Muise</a>, Jayme Turney and  others. This original project won first place after being initiated at a hackathon hosted by Random Hacks of Kindness Toronto (RHoKTO) in December 2012. It was later lovingly incubated by the now defunct <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20181223010237/http://publicspaces.ca/">Toronto Public Space Initiative</a>.</p>
